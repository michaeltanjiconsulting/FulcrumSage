## Strategic Intelligence Improvement Program

The past decade has seen an explosive proliferation of commercial cyber intelligence programs. Whether it is an internal team serving the needs of a single company, or a service provider striving to meet the needs of a portfolio of clients, the demand for intelligence has never been greater.

But an examination of the state of cyber intelligence reveals that not all programs are equal.  In some cases, based on management feedback, the value of an intelligence program canâ€™t be found at all. Skills, experience, rigor, and expertise can vary widely, which has a direct impact on program efficacy.

The Strategic Intelligence Improvement Program (SIIP) identifies the factors that prevent your intelligence program from operating effectively and delivering the timely insight decision-makers demand. We know what it takes to build and operate a world-class, globally-scalable cyber intelligence operation because we were there at the beginning, and we can put that invaluable experience to work for you.
