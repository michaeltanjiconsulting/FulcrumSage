### Cybersecurity Strategy & Leadership

You know you need to improve your cybersecurity posture. What you don’t know is how you’re going to do it. Finding the right people is nearly impossible. Technical solutions and services abound, but which ones are right for you? Every option is so expensive, but no one will guarantee success.

Let us cut through the hype, confusion, and spin to identify approaches and **solutions that will work best for you and how you do business.** You don't have to spend a fortune, or hunt for 'unicorn' level talent, to significantly reduce your risk.


### Intelligence Research & Analysis

Intelligence has nothing to do with secrets. Intelligence is the result of methodology and expert insight applied to information. You have more information than you can effectively consume, yet you are expected to make important decisions with the same speed and confidence as you did before we were drowning in content. 

We apply tried and proven analytic techniques to produce insights and assessments that you can use to make better decisions.


### Strategic Forecasting & Futures

The world is changing fast and those changes are increasingly disruptive. Your ability to survive, much less thrive, depends on being able to navigate those changes. 

We help you craft visions of the future and identify the indicators that point to potential outcomes, allowing you to take the action necessary to bring about the future you want, before it is too late.
