## Intelligence Research, Analysis & Forecasting

The vast majority of executives polled said they received effectively no value from their intelligence service provider. Inevitably, those executives bought a feed, or information (news), not intelligence. True intelligence is information put in context, subjected to methodology and expert insight, that is readily consumable and enables you to make better decisions.

With 20 years of experience as an intelligence analyst, you can be assured that answers to your questions will be developed by a practitioner who has worked on a range of diverse problems of national and international import. You will have the insight you need to support better decision-making, understand what it will take to achieve your goals, and recognize the signals that indicate both forward progress, and when a course correction may need to be made.
